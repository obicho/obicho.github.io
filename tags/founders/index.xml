      <description>Lately I noticed many startups operate in a totally distributed fashion. They donâ€™t have an office. Founders / founding team live in different city / state / country. Their funding comes from VCs and angel investors in different city / state / country. They are on Zoom a lot. They meet once a quarter or year for a team building event. When possible, they outsource non-core competencies to a third party.</description>
