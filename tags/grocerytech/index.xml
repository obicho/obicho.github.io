      <description>Before the pandemic, shopping for groceries used to be a giant production for my family. Every weekend, we would set aside a few hours, load our kids into our car, bring our shopping bags, pick some groceries at a local supermarket, bag everything, drive home, unload everything from the car, etc. And, repeat all over the following weekend. Argh!
Then, came the pandemic, and everything changed!
Instacart and other grocery shopping startups really started to enjoy a boom because nobody was going out.</description>
