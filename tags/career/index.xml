      <description>Have you been duped by deep fake videos during the hiring process? Earlier year, we almost did, while we were hiring developers.
We put out an Indeed job posting, and we started getting job inquiries almost right away. After we started screening, junior screeners reported seeing something odd.
Some said that candidatesâ€™ enunciation did not match the shape of mouths in the Zoom video. Some complained the lag was so bad that it was impossible to conduct a video interview.</description>

      <description>The amazing thing about meeting people in tech is that you can put people in two camps. The first camp is the founder type: they have a strong vision and want to build something to change the world. You can feel the energy blasting from every cell when they speak.
People in the second camp are professionals. They work for wonderful corporations and they are masters in what they do. Every step of the way, they work hard to build their career.</description>

      <description>Some time in spring this year, I went to UCLA to recruit interns. While I was there, I gave a talk which ended up attracting quite a few interns working with me. Some people really enjoyed the talk so I decided to clean up my notes and publish them here. Hopefully, you will find it useful, too.
The Origin:
Many years ago, there was a college kid who was interested in an internship position at a tech startup.</description>

      <description>About the Talk Why do some people become great software engineers very quickly, commanding high 6 figure salaries and writing code that disrupts industries? In this talk, we examine closely the career path of a software engineer and how to go about hacking it so that one can become good at what they do in a meaningful way.
