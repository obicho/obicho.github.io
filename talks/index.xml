There are so many technology tools that can help a startup in the initiation phase. It almost cost just a fraction of what it used to be 10 years ago, both in terms of time and resources, to bring a product to market for validation. However, it is challenging to build a GREAT company that can make a dent in this entropic universe we live in.</description>
