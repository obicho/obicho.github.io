      <description>I have been meeting a lot of great technical leaders lately. Not a single one of them had the same career path. Here is an ascii illustration of various possible ways you can become a CTO. It could be useful for someone navigating their career in software technology.

      <title>Career planning, or not</title>

      <description>The amazing thing about meeting people in tech is that you can put people in two camps. The first camp is the founder type: they have a strong vision and want to build something to change the world. You can feel the energy blasting from every cell when they speak.
People in the second camp are professionals. They work for wonderful corporations and they are masters in what they do. Every step of the way, they work hard to build their career.</description>

      <title>Myths about software engineers</title>
      <link>https://obicho.github.io/essays/myths-about-software-engineers/</link>

      <description>They are super opinionated. An engineer who likes to apply one particular technology on every problem is not a good engineer. They are just being opinionated for no good reason. A good engineer would look at the problem, analyze it and then find the best solution (tools, programming language, etc). Experienced engineers would definitely have an opinion about different technologies but they would never enforce.
They are difficult to work with.</description>

      <title>An omakase sushi chef and a software engineer</title>
      <link>https://obicho.github.io/essays/a-sushi-chef-and-a-programmer/</link>

      <guid>https://obicho.github.io/essays/a-sushi-chef-and-a-programmer/</guid>
      <description>Lately, I have been watching Michelin star sushi chefs on Youtube preparing fish for serving omakase behind a sushi bar. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a more traditional sushi restaurant experience, omakase is the way to go. You&amp;rsquo;ll be seated at the sushi bar in front of the chef, so you can easily chat and watch as your meal is made. The chef will also likely share stories and insights about their career, adding to the overall atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Asking for feedback</title>

      <description>Often times, my direct reports ask for my feedback. It could be for a 1-on-1, a performance review or just a sync. Sometimes, I find it stifling though. Feedback sounds overpowering and very top down.
I love giving feedback but what I love more is having a conversation. Conversation implies there is no judgement. It is a two-way discussion. From a manager&amp;rsquo;s point of view, it gives others the freedom to express.</description>

      <description>Some time in spring this year, I went to UCLA to recruit interns. While I was there, I gave a talk which ended up attracting quite a few interns working with me. Some people really enjoyed the talk so I decided to clean up my notes and publish them here. Hopefully, you will find it useful, too.
The Origin:
Many years ago, there was a college kid who was interested in an internship position at a tech startup.</description>

About the Talk Every great career begins with a dream. However, that alone is often not enough. A dreamer must be given the opportunity to try, to fail and to succeed. In 1999, I was fortunate enough to go to Tokyo for a summer internship. That’s where I met Joi Ito, got exposed to open source software for the first time and much more. It was a life-changing experience and even today I continue to cherish it.</description>

      <description>A message sent through Slack to the team announcing an internship graduation.
A long long time ago, there was a boy who wasn’t fortunate in his career. After graduating from college, he had been in transition a few times, working on stuff that was neither meaningful nor rewarding.
One day, he came across a job posting at Camino for an internship opportunity. In winter, we interviewed him but we didn’t bring him onboard.</description>

      <description>In 1999 while still a sophomore in college, I was given a chance that completely changed the course of my life. I met Kaoru Hayashi, the CEO and co-founder of a Tokyo tech startup called Digital Garage (now a publicly traded company in Japan) and he offered me a 3-month internship at his startup in Tokyo. Till this date, I still cherish every moment of that internship experience - learning how to code for the first time in Python and Zope, being exposed to open source technologies, meeting up with Joi Ito (then an entrepreneur, now a director at MIT Media Lab), supporting a live web coverage at Fuji Rock concert, hanging out with cool Tokyo teenagers and more.</description>
