      <description>Have you been duped by deep fake videos during the hiring process? Earlier year, we almost did, while we were hiring developers.
We put out an Indeed job posting, and we started getting job inquiries almost right away. After we started screening, junior screeners reported seeing something odd.
Some said that candidates’ enunciation did not match the shape of mouths in the Zoom video. Some complained the lag was so bad that it was impossible to conduct a video interview.</description>
