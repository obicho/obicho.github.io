      <title>I used AI to create this music track</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know any musical instrument or how to read a score.
I never had any type of music education.
I may even be a bit tone deaf.
So I just went to an AI program and clicked a button.
And, this came out.
I thought this may be good enough for the music to a game trailer.</description>

      <title>A smarter crosswalk</title>

      <description>Crosswalks have been around a long time but they don’t ever change. I closely observed one today. There is a sign that says ‘Push button for Pedestrian Crossing’. And then, there is a countdown signal forever pestering people to walk faster.
I think this is very dated. With Tesla able to autopilot itself today, I am sure the technology exists for sensors and cameras to detect the presence of pedestrians.</description>

      <description>Today I use an AI tool to draw a picture of Steve Jobs eating sushi. This is what I got:
Remembering what I read in Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, Jobs&amp;rsquo; favorite food was sushi. Although Jobs had a turbulent relationship with Lisa, he often recounted the good times while eating sushi in Tokyo with his daughter. Trust me, I have tried on a number of different AI image generator sites, including DALL.</description>
