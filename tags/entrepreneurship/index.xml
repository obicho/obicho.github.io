      <description>Being a real estate agent has always been a good option for people who want to generate income while maintaining a flexible schedule. Often, they only work on weekends to show houses and then at night, after kids go to sleep, they would write up the contracts. During the week, they socialize and meet people physically. Agents too invest time on digital campaigns over emails and social media to bring about awareness.</description>

      <description>This summer we took Amtrak from Los Angeles to San Francisco. What was supposed to be a joyful, scenic ride turned out to be a laborious trip. The train ride going north took 10 hours. Although we had bought tickets online, it was not clear to me why we were only assigned seats once we boarded the train. The conductor scanned the barcode on my ticket, and, assuming the ticket was valid, placed a little slip of paper above my seat that indicated what stop we were getting off at.</description>
