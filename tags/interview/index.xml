      <description>About the Talk For a startup founder in the impact space, it is not that difficult to just build a company. There are so many technology tools that can help a startup in the initiation phase. It almost cost just a fraction of what it used to be 10 years ago, both in terms of time and resources, to bring a product to market for validation. However, it is challenging to build a GREAT company that can make a dent in this entropic universe we live in.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I was invited to be a guest on a high profile fintech podcast called Hitechies. It was fantastic to speak with the host, Pramod Dhakal, who is based in Belgium.
We talked casually how I started in fintech with Camino Financial, then how I transitioned to proptech in the midst of the pandemic. I touched on how blockchain is revolutionizing the real estate space and my outlook on the future of crypto, online lending and fintech in general.</description>

About the Talk Every great career begins with a dream. However, that alone is often not enough. A dreamer must be given the opportunity to try, to fail and to succeed. In 1999, I was fortunate enough to go to Tokyo for a summer internship. Thatâ€™s where I met Joi Ito, got exposed to open source software for the first time and much more. It was a life-changing experience and even today I continue to cherish it.</description>
