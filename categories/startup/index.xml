      <title>Startup, totally distributed</title>

      <description>Lately I noticed many startups operate in a totally distributed fashion. They don’t have an office. Founders / founding team live in different city / state / country. Their funding comes from VCs and angel investors in different city / state / country. They are on Zoom a lot. They meet once a quarter or year for a team building event. When possible, they outsource non-core competencies to a third party.</description>

      <description>Over the last decade, South America has been a popular place to recruit technology talents. I really enjoy working with technology teams from the region. Its close proximity to US, time zone overlap and a large talent pool are the main reasons why it has worked for me.
Here are my favorite places:
Mexico’s Guadalajara Guadalajara is a gem of the Latin American software industry and has become a cutting-edge city with a robust tech ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Real Estate Agent Moms (dads)</title>

      <description>Being a real estate agent has always been a good option for people who want to generate income while maintaining a flexible schedule. Often, they only work on weekends to show houses and then at night, after kids go to sleep, they would write up the contracts. During the week, they socialize and meet people physically. Agents too invest time on digital campaigns over emails and social media to bring about awareness.</description>

      <description>Before the pandemic, shopping for groceries used to be a giant production for my family. Every weekend, we would set aside a few hours, load our kids into our car, bring our shopping bags, pick some groceries at a local supermarket, bag everything, drive home, unload everything from the car, etc. And, repeat all over the following weekend. Argh!
Then, came the pandemic, and everything changed!
Instacart and other grocery shopping startups really started to enjoy a boom because nobody was going out.</description>

      <description>What percentage of Y Combinator founders are technical?
Nobody really keeps track of this data. I looked. However, based on my research, it seems that typically at least one co-founder is more on the technical side within a startup. Anecdotally, I happen to know quite a few co-founders who are engineers by training and got funding from Mucker Capital.
As more businesses become accessible online, it is almost impossible to ignore the fact that a person with a technical background is better suited to run a company.</description>

      <description>Lately, admin panel seems to be a recurring theme in my life. I had a discussion with someone at a startup about which one to use.
Needless to say, there is plenty of options in the market place &amp;ndash; everything from home brew custom solution to managed services to low-code platforms. Stuff like this obviously requires some research before any commitment. Since the company needing this is a very early stage startup.</description>

      <title>Columbia Venture Community: Why you will fail to build a great social impact startup</title>

      <description>About the Talk For a startup founder in the impact space, it is not that difficult to just build a company. There are so many technology tools that can help a startup in the initiation phase. It almost cost just a fraction of what it used to be 10 years ago, both in terms of time and resources, to bring a product to market for validation. However, it is challenging to build a GREAT company that can make a dent in this entropic universe we live in.</description>

About the Talk Every great career begins with a dream. However, that alone is often not enough. A dreamer must be given the opportunity to try, to fail and to succeed. In 1999, I was fortunate enough to go to Tokyo for a summer internship. That’s where I met Joi Ito, got exposed to open source software for the first time and much more. It was a life-changing experience and even today I continue to cherish it.</description>

      <title>Open Letter: Reflecting on the recruiting event at Caltech</title>

      <description>Hello Team,
Today we had a recruiting event at Caltech (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology) and I was humbled by the experience.
It was intimidating at first. For the very first time, I saw Camino Financial trying to recruit, in the physical world, alongside great technology giants like Google, Facebook and Activision. I was literally flanked by a Google booth to my right and a Facebook/Instagram booth to my left. To make matters worse, I was outnumbered (each company had at least 4 engineers per booth) and I was a little late to the campus (carried our poster and my computer monitor on my own while trying to find parking, after our sprint planning meeting).</description>

      <description>A sickly-looking man, walking like a zombie, crossed my path in the middle of the road as I drove through Skid Row to get to office. While waiting for him to pass, I looked to the left and only to find more disturbing scenes: a few homeless people in a tent shooting drugs up their arms and a soup kitchen filled with people whose despair-stricken eyes were staring right back at me.</description>

      <description>In 1999 while still a sophomore in college, I was given a chance that completely changed the course of my life. I met Kaoru Hayashi, the CEO and co-founder of a Tokyo tech startup called Digital Garage (now a publicly traded company in Japan) and he offered me a 3-month internship at his startup in Tokyo. Till this date, I still cherish every moment of that internship experience - learning how to code for the first time in Python and Zope, being exposed to open source technologies, meeting up with Joi Ito (then an entrepreneur, now a director at MIT Media Lab), supporting a live web coverage at Fuji Rock concert, hanging out with cool Tokyo teenagers and more.</description>

      <description>After 10+ hours of flight, I finally arrived in Beijing.
The invitation was hard to resist. The opportunity to start a new venture in Beijing sounded like an adventure not to be missed. This brought me to Beijing. My other co-founders literally got the keys to our loft that very same day I arrived. I was greeted by my CEO who just dashed in from the hospital as someone in his family had passed away a few hours earlier.</description>
